Here is my personal page website project. I am making a blog, of sorts, to show off fun Electrical Engineering projects I have done and will be doing in the future. It also serves to be a portfolio; keeping an online record of these things which other people can come and see. I started this website from a template but have made ample changes to it which serves as another project in itself. It is a way for me to learn web design at the same time as being able to share my creations with the world. Let me know if there is anything that could be improved upon, this site is always a work in progress.
