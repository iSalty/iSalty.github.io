Here is my personal website which is serving as a kind of project portfolio. In it you will find the different engineering projects I have brought to life throughout my academic, personal, and professional careers. Additionally, most of the code for the projects has been uploaded to GitHub for others to enjoy - the links are found throughout the project pages. I intend to keep adding to this website as I do more and more projects, stay tuned.
