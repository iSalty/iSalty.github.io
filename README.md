Here is my personal page website project. I am making a blog of sorts to show off fun Electrical Engineering projects I have done and will be doing in the future. I also serves to be a portfolio of sorts keeping a online record of these things which other people can come and see. I have made this website myself (written the HTML and CSS code) as a project and would like any feedback regarding the website as a whole, things I could improve on or experiment with. I hope this site is as fun to read as it was to make.
