							<h2>3D Printed LED Lamp</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I wanted to expand the list of microcontrollers that I had experience with and I saw that the ESP8266 was more capable than an Arduino, had WiFi connectivity, 
							and came at a cheaper price. I had also recently purchased a 3D printer and wanted to try my hand designing models in CAD and printing them to quickly itterate 
							on an idea. Putting these two things together, I came up with a geometric lamp design and soon enough I had a working prototype in my hands.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>ESP8266 Microcontroller</li>
							<li>Neopixel 12 LED Ring</li>
							<li>Momentary Push Button</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>CAD Model Design</h3>
						<p>This was my first time using CAD programs to do any projects and it was a big learning experience for me. I started with <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" target="blank">TinkerCAD</a>, 
							which was the simplest to get working with, but this project required a bit more precision so I moved to <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal" target="blank">Fusion360</a> which can be used 
							for free for personal projects. Here the CAD diagram is shown, the pentagonal base is made up of 3 pieces, and the lamp shade is a single piece.
						</p>

						<h3>3D Printer</h3>
						<p>I had heard about 3D printers in my schooling at Arizona State University but I had never really had any hands on time with them so I decided to purchase one for myself.
							I learned a lot about the machine during this project, previously, I hadn't realized just how precise it could be and the level of calibration that needs to be done for 
							it to work properly.
						</p>

						<h3>Software</h3>
						<p>The ESP8266 is at the heart of the design running C code which controls the LEDs and monitoring the button which allows the user to change colors. Currently, the lamp just
							does some static colors, but in the future I intend on linking the lamp to the internet so that its color can change in relation to some information on the web (I am thinking
							weather). The user presses down on the top of the lamp (which depresses the button at the bottom) thus triggering a state change in the software.

						<h3>About Me</h3>
						<p>I am an Electrical Engineer from Arizona who is passionate about new levels of interconnection through technology.
							Starting my career with Ford was an eye-opening experience; learning about the automotive industry, vehicle automation 
							and electrification. It showed me there are a lot of new engineering challenges in the automotive space right now and 
							plenty of opportunities to be involved in meaningful work, not just for the company, but for something bigger. </p>
