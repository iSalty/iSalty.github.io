				<p class="post-text"> 
					Hi, I am a recent graduate from Arizona State University in the field of Electrical Engineering. I have been involved in a few noteworthy projects during my time in college and would love to continue tinkering and inventing on my own time. I intend for this to be the site where others can come to see what projects I have been working on and my thought process throughout the time that I was involved in those projects. 
				</p>
				<p class="post-text">
					I am putting together this website to serve as a platform to share the many fun and interesting projects I am working on and to serve as some sort of a portfolio of my projects. Building this website was a project in itself. Never before have I had any experience with web design and I wanted to learn how to make a website essentially only using the barebones HTML and CSS code. So I headed over to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank"> codecademy.com</a> and spent a day learning HTML, CSS and the bootstrap framework in the Making a Website course. I spent another day scouring the internet to find inspiration on the asthetic of the website. Finally, I spent one day sitting down and coding the thing. It surprised me just how quickly I picked it up and I really ended up enjoying it. Having complete control over the layout (down to the pixel) and being able to see the changes with a simple refresh was a very exciting way to make progress. Nevertheless, this is the result, the page you are looking at and interacting with. It is my first experience with web design and, I have to say, I am quite pleased with the results. You can find the code for this website on <a href="https://github.com/iSalty/iSalty.github.io" target="_blank">my GitHub page</a> if you are interested. Hopefully this blog proves to be as much fun to read as it is for me to create and update.

				<h3 class="post-title">LED Bike Wheel: 1</h3>
				<p class="post-text">
					The 'LED Bike Wheel' was the title of my senior design project from Arizona State University. It was completed over the last year of school with two of my good buddies from college, Matthew Jackson and Cameron Mahai. It was the last project that I worked on in college and would love to highlight it here because it was such a fun and interesting project. 
				</p>
				<p class="post-text">
					Living in Tempe (one of the most bikeable cities in the US) we encountered many bikes in our daily lives. It was how all three of us (Matt, Cameron, and myself) commuted to campus and back everyday of the week. Bikes, being so central to our daily lives, were at the forefront of our thoughts when it came time to pick a project topic in the Fall of 2015. We had all seen people attempt to put lights on their bikes, but most were just sad strands of LEDs that just went about, producing nothing but a wiggly circle. We wanted take that idea and kick it up a notch. 
				</p>
				<p class="post-text">
					Thus the idea was born that there could be static images displayed on the bike wheel as the bike was in motion using the physical phenomenon of Persistence of Vision. Persistence of Vision is the explanation of how the human eye to retains a discrete image of light for fractions of a second after it has gone. “Whenever light strikes the retina, the brain retains the impression of that light for about a tenth of a second…after the source of the light is removed. As a result, the eye cannot clearly distinguish fast changes in light that occur faster than this retention period.” <a href="http://www.foundationsmag.com/persistence_of_vision.html" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This phenomenon has inspired the creation of many technologies. It is at the core of how motion is perceived by us in movies or on television screens <a href="http://www.foundationsmag.com/persistence_of_vision.html" target="_blank">[1]</a>. The LED Bike Wheel would be able to utilize the sluggishness of the human eye and mind to not only create animation (using multiple frames in succession) but also to create the screen itself. In the assembly there would exists only a few pixels, but when spinning around at a fast enough rate each pixel is perceived by the mind as a solid circle. The color of any point on those circles can be controlled to produce the desired image. An illustration of POV as it relates to our bike display is shown below. 
				</p>
				<div>
					<img class="post-image" src="Pictures/paint of square to polar.png" height="400px" width="auto"/>
				</div>
				<p class="post-text">
					Each blue circle represents what our minds would see from a lit single pixel, rotating about the center faster than our brains could compensate. It is clear to see where in the rotation each LED would need to turn red in order to create the image of the red square, and it is the goal of this project to design a system to do so.

				<h3 class="post-title">LED Bike Wheel: 2</h3>
				<p class="post-text">
					Unsurprisingly, we were not the first people to think of this. However, the other similar projects which have been completed are fairly recent and our project has its own advantages. Here are a couple of products / projects similar to ours worth checking out.
				</p>
				<ul class="post-bullets">
					<li><a href="http://www.monkeylectric.com/monkey_light_pro/" target="_blank">MonkeyLectric's Monkey Light Pro</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://revolights.com/" target="_blank">Revolights</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="post-text">
					The MonkeyLectric one is really quite impressive with the quality of the images they are able to recreate. Nevertheless, they have encountered some problems which we have improved upon. MonkeyLectric's product uses Bluetooth to transfer the images from a phone (only iOs at the moment) and does the image processing on the phone as well. After looking through the MonkeyLectric forums we identified that the Bluetooth transfer rate was slow and the processing on phone would drain people's battery and even cause some heat problems. Therefore we elected to have our device work over WiFi (capable of recieving transfers from any internet connected device) and to do the necessary image processing on the bike wheel assembly. Knowing that we needed a pretty powerful system we elected to go with a Raspberry Pi 2: Model B+. It has an ARM compatible CPU which has a clock rate of 900MHz which we could then easily overclock to 1000MHz and is trivial to connect to WiFi (using a $5 WiFi dongle).

				<h3 class="post-title">LED Bike Wheel: 3</h3>
				<p class="post-text">
					Now that we had decided what the product was supposed to be and do, it was time to get to work on actually prototyping it. First up was learning how to work with the Raspberry Pi. It was the first time any of us had worked with microcontrollers like this, fortunatley, the RPi is what is termed a microcomputer. Basically it is a fully functional computer, just miniaturized, complete with a GUI for the desktop and file system. We utilized the Raspbian Jessie operating system which is built on Linux. Therefore, eventhough it has a fully function GUI, it was still beneficial to learn how to work within the command line because of how useful it is on Linux platforms. 
				</p>
				<p class="post-text">
					After fimiliarizing myself with the command line I decided that I wanted to write my first program on the RPi and have it light up some LEDs. The Raspberry Pi has great built in functionality with Python programs and therefore Python was the language of choice when writing most of my programs. Again, I had some learning to do because I had never written a program in Python. I did, however, have a good working knowledge of C++ so it came to me quick. Using these <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/302?gclid=Cj0KEQjw6O-9BRDjhYXH2bOb8Z4BEiQAWRdukxl-JQYDdKpD95jpF_yId-9EI2LiMlpYy1B5FyyQqVoaAvEP8P8HAQ" target="_blank">common anode RGB LEDs</a> I purchased from Adafruit and some resistors I had lying around I was able to quickly whip up <a href="https://github.com/iSalty/LED-Bike-Wheel/blob/master/drive-download-20160823T233046Z/colorFunc.py" target="_blank">this program</a>. The program changes the colors of two LEDs simply by controlling specific GPIO pins to be on or off. A video of the program running can be seen below.

				<h3 class="post-title">LED Bike Wheel: 4</h3>
				<p class="post-text">
					I had shown that the LEDs could be controlled simply through the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. However, we wanted a lot of LEDs on our bike wheel (48 to be exact) and there simply were not enough GPIO pins on the RPi to accomodate that number of LEDs. After some research we elected to go with adding GPIO expander chips from Microchip (the MCP23S17) which would add 16 GPIO ports per chip. In theory the RPi could accomodate adding up to 16 MCP23S17s, we ended up using 12. 
				</p>
				<p class="post-text">
					The reason we needed so many extra ports was because each individual RGB LED required 4 GPIO pins to be controlled. The four pins would control the Red, Green, and Blue pins, as well as Power to the LED. Below, you can see a pin diagram the RGB LEDs we used and the scheme used to hook them up to the MCP2317s to be controlled.   
				</p>
				<div>
					<img class="post-image" src="Pictures/rgbLED_MCP.PNG"/>
				</div>
				<p class="post-text">
					Because the LEDs used in this assembly are common anode, 5v is put into the common anode and the current flows through wherever there is a voltage differential. Consequently, it runs backwards, in a sense. For example, if Red was the desired color of the LED, the pins would have to be controlled in the following way, [B:1, G:1, R:0, Pow:1]. This way there is only a voltage difference between the voltage input (anode) and the desired return path, red; thus, the LED turns red. 
				</p>
				<p class="post-text">
					The MCP23S17 also added the functionality of being able to write to it a whole byte at a time. This allows us to control one side (2 LEDs)of the MCP23S17 with a single write command. Thus defining the colors as hexadecimal values would make the process of doing this much easier. A table of the colors and their equivalent Hex values is shown below. This will come in handy later when we examine the code that conducts the LEDs during runtime.

					It took some time to figure out how to properly talk to the MCP23S17 chips in the code but one specific library was my saving grace, <a href="http://wiringpi.com/" target="_blank">wiringPi</a> by drogon. This specific library has a lot of built in functionality for interfacing with some chips commonly used with the RPi. It provided a simple way to conduct the MCP23S17 chips over the SPI interface.
				</p>
				<p class="post-text">
					Anyway, once I was able to figure out how to work with 4 LEDs connected to one of the MCP23S17 chips it became apparent how we were going to be able to scale up to deal with 48 LEDs. Initially we wanted to design the device to be on Printed Circuit Boards. However, when looking into the moetary cost and, even more importantly, the time cost to have them made and shipped to us we realized that going down this route would leave us with little wiggle room if something were to go wrong. Therefore, we elected to design the product on <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/591" target="_blank">solderable breadboards</a>, specialized for prototyping. The solderable breadboards would give us the most flexibility if we made a mistake and were also significantly cheaper than doing the layout on a printed circuit board. The solderable breadboard layout I came up with can be seen below.  
				</p>
				<div>
					<img class="post-image" src="Pictures/SolderableBreadboardLayout.PNG" height="400px"/>
				</div>
				<p class="post-text">
					As you can see in the diagram above, there would be four boards making up the LED Bike Wheel assembly. Each board contains 12 LEDs and the chips needed to control them as well as the appropriate resistors (all 1k&#937). At the top of each board is a Hall effect sensor which is responsible for keeping track of the rate of rotation of the wheel and will be talked about more in a later post.

				<p class="post-text">
					So we got to work assembling the boards seen in the above diagrams. Because we elected to create our assembly on solderable breadboards we had a considerable amount of soldering ahead of us. None of us had extensive experience soldering before, but by the end of it we were all experts. Each board took around 2-3 hours of soldering to complete and plenty of errors had to be corrected. Our first complete board can be seen in the images below (top = front) (bottom = back).

				</div>
				<p class="post-text">
					You can see what a mess the wires were on the back of the board, thus the back of the LED Bike Wheel assembly came to be known as the "rat's nest". However, we didn't want the loose wires to get caught on the bike as it was in motion so we took care to neatly zip-tie them to each other as well as to the spokes of the bike wheel (this can be seen in a later post with the full assembly on the bike). 
				</p>
				<p class="post-text">
					Now that the actual hardware portion of the build was complete it was time to focus on the software. The software would handle how to coordinate all 48 LEDs in order to generate a standing image on the bike wheel. But first things first, we just wanted to see if our hack job of a hardware prototype could light up. I had written <a href="https://github.com/iSalty/LED-Bike-Wheel/blob/master/drive-download-20160823T233046Z/rainbow.py" target="_blank">some code here</a> in which I could specify the colors of 12 LEDs and it was finally time to test it out. Unsurprisingly, on the first try, nothing happened. After checking the wiring with a digital multimeter, swapping out a few resistors, and resoldering some wires we were able to get it working. Below you can see an image of all 12 LEDs lighting up in a rainbow fashion.

				<h3 class="post-title">LED Bike Wheel: 7</h3>
				<p class="post-text">
					In software there are two programs which are central to the design; polarRead and LEDcontrol. Both programs are written in python and operate on the Raspberry Pi which is located on the bike wheel. PolarRead does the image processing before the image can be displayed, and LEDcontrol outputs the proper image to the LEDs on the Bike Wheel. We will look at polarRead.py in more detail here.
				</p>
				<p class="post-text">
					<a href="https://github.com/iSalty/LED-Bike-Wheel/blob/master/drive-download-20160823T233046Z/polarRead.py" target="_blank">PolarRead.py</a> is the program responsible for reading in any image, determining what colors the LEDs should be at each point of the display and saving the data to be used in the other program, LEDcontrol. An image editing library, OpenCV, was utilized in this program because it contains functions already written which are relevant and usable in our design. This image library allows the software to do the appropriate image processing on any type of image (.jpg, .gif, .png, etc). First, the image is read in, then it is resized to 360px by 360px so that a constant resolution is achieved for the bike wheel display. This resolution contains data for 360 degrees of rotation which is necessary to have an image detailed enough to display well on the bike wheel. 
				</p>
				<p class="post-text">
					Next the image has to be converted from Cartesian (x, y) coordinates to polar coordinates (r, θ). Polar coordinates contain data on the radius(r) and angle(θ) of each pixel and, therefore, provide a simpler way to track where the LED boards are and what color they should be as they rotate with the wheel. The function to go from Cartesian coordinates to polar has already been written in the openCV library and is used in this program to do the transformation. However, it is still necessary to understand how this function works in order to properly extract the desired data from its output. A demonstration of its operation is shown in the figure below. Cartesian image (left) to Polar image (right).
				</p>
				<div class="col-sm-12">
					<img class="post-image" src="Pictures/polarRead_prntScrn1.jpg"/>
				</div>
				<p class="post-text">
					The black line shown in the Cartesian image indicates the line where the transformation begins. It takes this line of colors and prints it at the top of the polar image assigning it θ = 0&deg. The transformation then proceeds, swinging the black line around clockwise and printing down on the polar image, every degree rotation clockwise on the cartesian image corresponds to one new row on the polar image. The left side of the polar image represents colors closer to the center of the cartesian image, and the right side of the polar image represents colors furthest away from the center.
				</p>
				<p class="post-text">
					Once the image is in polar format it is easy to extract the relavent color data. Because there are 12 LEDs on each LED board we need to find what color each LED is at each degree of the image, thus we need 12 colors for each degree of the 360 degrees of rotation. This program looks at 12 equidistant pixels for each degree, determines their colors and saves it as a color character (a letter representing the color). These color characters are then saved into a text file which is utilized in the LEDcontrol program. A selection of the color characters saved for the above image can be seen below (again left = centermost).

				<h3 class="post-title">LED Bike Wheel: 8</h3>
				<p class="post-text">
					Finally, we can take a look at the second program <a href="https://github.com/iSalty/LED-Bike-Wheel/blob/master/drive-download-20160823T233046Z/LEDcontrol.py" target="_blank">LEDcontrol.py</a> which is the program that actually runs while the bike wheel is in motion. It is responsible for keeping track of the speed of the bike as well as updating the LEDs with the correct colors every single degree of rotation (can be as fast as once every millisecond). Here I will delve a bit into how the program functions to accomplish this. 
				</p>
				<p class="post-text">
					Initially, the text file (created from the polarRead program) is read in which contains the list of 4320 color characters (12x360), multiple text files can be read; each representing a single frame of an image. Using multiple frames in quick succession allows the LED Bike Wheel to display animations. Now that the color characters are available, they need to be translated into something the computer can understand to properly output to the LEDs, therefore they are translated into bytes using the scheme seen back in post: LED Bike Wheel 4. I have shown the table below again to demonstrate how the color characters are represented in hex.
				</p>
				<div>
					<img class="post-image" src="Pictures/4.2.2.2.PNG">
				</div>
				<p class="post-text">
					A byte is 8 bits, a hexidecimal number is 4 bits, therefore two hex numbers make up a byte. This means that a byte carries with it the data for the colors of two LEDs (1 hex value per LED). The wiringPi library allows us to write to the MCP23S17 using a buffer containing two bytes of information. Because of this we want to combine our hex values into bytes which we then represent in decimal. This process proved to be more complicated than it initially seemed due to the way in which we wired up the LEDs to the MCP23S17 chips. Below I have shown a set of data which had been taken from the color characters, to hex, and finally to decimal. The whole process of going from color characters to decimal values happens within the first 140 lines of <a href="https://github.com/iSalty/LED-Bike-Wheel/blob/master/drive-download-20160823T233046Z/LEDcontrol.py" target="_blank">LEDcontrol.py</a>. The write commands that actually send the data out (wiringPiSPIDataRW(_)) to the LEDs can be seen around lines 911-922 of the code.
				</p>
				<div>
					<img class="post-image" src="Pictures/realDeal_prntScrn.jpg">
				</div>
				<p class="post-text">
					You will notice how things in the hex list seem out of place, this is due to the 'complexity' mentioned above with the way that the LEDs were wired to the MCP23S17 chips. This was done to keep track of which LEDs are located in the positions that the Most Significant Bits control. Therefore the hex list looks to the second color char then to the first, then to the fourth, then to the third, and so on.
